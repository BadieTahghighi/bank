# Assignment I: Search Structure, Dictionary, and Data Aggregation 
### 1- Form groups of 2 to 3 and complete the code for bank in the lab/tutorial.

### 2- Create 1000 random accounts and measure/print the average add, find, city aggregation and range aggregation for both bank I and bank II.

### 3- Use the simple Hash Table / Hash Map you developed in week 1 and extend it to a proper generic hashmap ( call it MyHashMap). You can use getHash() method in java to get the object hash code. Run the SearchStructure project by including your MyHashMap and create charts for find/insert/delete methods comparison for only java hashmap and your hashmap. Comment on the comparison.

### 4- Write a Bank3 class to do use your customized hashmap as search structure as well as a dictionary implemented by using your hashmap for data aggregation.

### 5- Change the BST code and make it generic. Write a Bank4 class to do use BST as search structure as well as a dictionary implemented by BST for data aggregation.


### 6- Use the idea for Coordinator from lecture code and create a coordinator to test your algorithms. Change n from 1 to 5000 and for each n do the experiment 100 times. Write everything in a CSV file and open it in Excel and clean the file and average the values for each n and demonstrate 4 charts:
#### n - Average add time for ArrayList, HashMap, MyHashMap, and BST
#### n - Average find time for ArrayList, HashMap, MyHashMap, and BST
#### n - Average city aggregation time for ArrayList, HashMap, MyHashMap, and BST
#### n - Average range aggregation time for ArrayList, HashMap, MyHashMap, and BST

### 7- Discuss these charts. What can you conclude from your experiments? Any idea to improve any of these algorithms?
* Only one member of the group should submit the work. Submit the java files, screenshots, text files, Excel file, and a technical report in MS-Word including all the charts and your discussion in one zip file. Include the name of all the group members in the technical report.
